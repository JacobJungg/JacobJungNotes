- **File descriptor**  
  - An integer that represents a file, path, or device.  
  - A process uses it to open files or directories.  
  - Each process has its own file descriptor table.  

- **`fork()`**  
  - Creates a new process.  
  - The child process inherits a copy of the parentâ€™s file descriptor table.
