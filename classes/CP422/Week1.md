## 🗝 Key Notes
- **4 Vs of Big Data (EXAM TIP):**
  - **Volume** – KB, MB, GB, TB, PB  
  - **Variety** – Video, Web, Photo, Audio  
  - **Velocity** – Batch, Periodic, **Real Time**  
    - Real-time = no accumulation, process and respond before next request arrives  
  - **Value** – Cost/utility, **should come first** (data must have business value)

- **Big Data ≠ Just Size:** involves **scale, distribution, timeliness** and new architectures.

- **Data Types:**  
  - Structured → schema enforced  
  - Semi-structured → tags, parseable (e.g. HTML)  
  - Quasi-structured → partial tags, inconsistent, mixed types  
  - Unstructured → no schema

## 📖 Lecture Summary

### 🔑 The Four V’s of Big Data
- **Volume** – Scale of data (KB → PB and beyond)
- **Variety** – Types of data (video, web, photos, audio)
- **Velocity** – Speed at which data is generated/processed  
  - **Batch** – process in chunks  
  - **Periodic** – process at intervals  
  - **Real-Time** – process instantly, respond before next request arrives
- **Value** – Most important!  
  - Cost and utility of data  
  - A model is worthless without *valued* data  

> **Exam Note:** 4 Vs are **definitely on the exam**

### 📊 Big Data Concepts
- Big Data = not just *size*, but also **scale, distribution, timeliness**
- IoT connects **everything to everything**
- **Quality of Life vs Quality of Service:**  
  - Small data = fast response, but may sacrifice service quality  
- Ability to **track everything, everywhere, anytime**

### 🗄 Big Data Structures
| Type              | Description / Key Points |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Structured**   | Schema enforced, smallest portion of data |
| **Semi-Structured** | Has tags, specific format, parseable (e.g., HTML) |
| **Quasi-Structured** | Some tags, inconsistent format, hard to categorize (float vs int, links) |
| **Unstructured** | No schema |

---

### 🧩 Typical Tasks
- **Problem Solving**
  - Think from perspective → choose right tools
  - Solve crises, design new solutions
  - Add systematic/mathematical operations to data  
- **Learning**
  - Build on prior knowledge  
- **Decision Making**
  - Process data → apply to make decisions  
- **Planning**
  - Identify objective → strategy → implementation → monitor

### 🚗 Example Scenario: Vehicle Commute Time Prediction
- **Data Sources:** Google API, Twitter API (tweets)
- **Collection:** Not covered clearly (lecture was unclear)
- **Extraction:** Time-series model used (level, season, etc.)
- **Application:** Lecturer gave an example from their master’s research
- **Other Factors:** Exogenous variables like weather, accidents, road rage, time of day

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- 4 Vs (Volume, Variety, Velocity, Value)
- Big Data = Scale + Distribution + Timeliness
- Data Types (Structured → Unstructured spectrum)
- Tasks: Problem Solving, Learning, Decision-Making, Planning
- Real-time processing → No accumulation of data

## 📝 Side Notes
- Lecturer got very passionate about this section (lots of shouting 😅)
- I think time of day is an easy variable, but other exogenous factors complicate modeling
- Stopped paying attention near the end — watched Jamarr Chase highlights instead 🏈
