    - Clean
      - - Remove outliers
      - Null values
      - Remove rows
      - Prepare data
    - Integrate
    - Package
    - Depends on what is missing
      - Merge duplicate records
      - outliers
      - Data with missing values
    - Feature selection
    - Dimensionality reduction
      - eg 3D -> 2D
- Analyze Data
  - Select analytical tech
    - Classification
      - Know or predict the item belongs to which category

    - Association analysis
      - Rules to capture assoications between items
      - Superstores, what items to put beside what items
    - Graph Analytics
      - Graph structures to find connections between entitites
      - Social network
      - Spider web

  - Select tecnhiq > Build model > Validate model 
- Communicate results
  -  Data-driven story telling
  -  What to report
  -  How to present
- Apply results
  - Determine next steps
  - Future opportunities
  - Revisit
  - Favorable results?
- What is datamining?
  - Knowledge discovery from dataGiven lots of Data
  - Discover patterns and models that are
    - Valid
      - Hold new data with some certainty
    - USeful
      - Why make if not USeful
      - SHould be possible to act on
    - Unexpected
      - Non obvious to the system
      - Solve a problem
    - Undstandable
      - Humans should be able to interpret the patterns
##SLIDE TWO
- Distributed File system
  - HDFS
    - H stands for Hadoop
    - Famous dfs
  - Long term info storage
  - Enable access of multiple processes
    - Parralel processing
    - Sub tasks same time
    - Give multiple access to itself
  - Not only for storing data
  - Processes data
  - Storage
    - Racks of nodes
    - One area
    - All of thema re connected with eachother
    - Store different chunks on different Racks
    - Need duplication of chunks
    - Store duplicate value on different racks as well
    - Never put same duplicate on same rack or same place
    - First divide into chunks, then make duplicate
    - If smth goes wrong, for example one of the racks has been dissconected, then you have access t all data on different chunks
  - Data partiononing
  - Data replication
  - Data Scaability
  - Fault tollerance
  - High concurrency
  - Example: Google
    - 20 Billion Web pages
    - Avg size of webpage 20kb (not actual number)
    - 20 billion X 20 kb = 400+ TB
    - If we want to search through this data, 1 computer reads 30-35 mb a second
      - 4 months
      - but google does it in miliseconds?
- Single Node Architecture
  - In a pc we have CPU and Memory
    - Consider 1 pc as 1 node in file system 
  - If we have a hard disk, we can store a chunk of data on disk
  - When we need we call disk and move data to processing
  - Move into memory and then apply the processing on data on memory
  - Classocal data mining
    - yap yap yap
    - This class whenever we want to do any example we will do it as a classical data mining
    - No server
    - No cloud
    - We just going to work on disk
    - Yeah idk what this guy is talking about i think just no 3rd party stuff so think of it as zero Build
- Cluster Architecture
  - Multiple ProcessesGbps between any pair of nodes in a rack
  - Chunks are stored on different nodes
  - We need a switch to recive data from one node to another
  - Stops bottlenecking
  - This is a big thing
- Commodity Cluster
  - "Distributed computing"
    - Over the Internet
  - Enables data-parralellism
  - Reduces computing cost
  - Network bottleneck
    - Other than storing files multiple times for reliability
    - Birng consumption close to the data
- Fault tollerance
  - Common Failures
    - Node failure
      - Single rack fails
    - Link failure
      - Connection from Netowrk to the rack fails
    - Rack failure
      - whole rack fails
    - Two-node connection failure
      - Link between two nodes fails
      - Like the wires or smth
  - Failure does not mean full restart
    - Potential for node-level system Failures
    - Redudant data storage
    - Data-parallel job restart
- Programming on top of distributed file systems
  - Split volumes of data
  - Access data fast
  - Distribute computations to nodes
