## üìñ Lecture Summary

- **Inductive Bias**  
  - Set of assumptions that define the model selection criteria  
  - Two types: **Restriction Bias** and **Preference Bias**  
  - Necessary for learning beyond the dataset  

- **Underfitting, Overfitting, and "Just Right" Models**  

- **Sources of Error**
  - **Bias**
    - Systematic error (leaning)
    - Simple models ‚Üí large bias (and vice versa)
  - **Variance**
    - Sensitivity to training data
    - Simple models ‚Üí lower variance; complex models ‚Üí higher variance  
  - **Key Insight:** More complex models do not always lead to better performance on test data  

- **Regularization**
  - **L1 Regularization** (Lasso)
  - **L2 Regularization** (Ridge)
  - Both will be on the exam  

- **TODO:** Watch a video to refresh these concepts
