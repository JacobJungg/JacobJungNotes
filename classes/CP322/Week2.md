## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- **Regression** â†’ Predicting continuous outcomes with a mathematical model  
- **Linear vs. Non-Linear Models** â†’ Shape of relationship between inputs & outputs  
- **Parametric vs. Non-Parametric** â†’ Fixed number of parameters vs. flexible models  
- **ML Pipeline (3 Steps)**:
  1. Define the function (hypothesis)
  2. Measure goodness of function (loss/cost function)
  3. Select the best function (training/optimization)

## ðŸ“– Lecture Summary
- **What is Regression?**
  - Regression is used to predict a continuous value (e.g., house price, temperature).
  - Represented as $y = f(x) + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is error/noise.
- **Linear vs. Non-Linear**
  - Linear â†’ Straight-line relationship between input features and output.
  - Non-Linear â†’ Curved/complex relationships (may need transformations or advanced models).
- **Parametric vs. Non-Parametric**
  - Parametric â†’ Pre-defined form with limited parameters (e.g., Linear Regression).
  - Non-Parametric â†’ Model complexity grows with data (e.g., k-NN, Decision Trees).
- **Three Steps for ML**
  - Define the hypothesis function (what we think the relationship looks like).
  - Choose a loss function to measure how good our predictions are.
  - Train/optimize to minimize loss and pick the best model.
